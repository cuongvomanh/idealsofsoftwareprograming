`write the code and unit test`

## ChatGPT
Here is the code to calculate the fee for payment in Java:

```java
public class PaymentFeeCalculator {
    
    public enum FeeType {
        FIXED,
        PERCENTAGE
    }
    
    public static double calculateFee(double paymentAmount, FeeType feeType) {
        switch(feeType) {
            case FIXED:
                return 2.0;
            case PERCENTAGE:
                return paymentAmount * 0.5;
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid fee type");
        }
    }
}
```

The above code contains a static method `calculateFee` which takes two parameters: `paymentAmount` and `feeType`. The `feeType` is an enum type with two values: `FIXED` and `PERCENTAGE`. 

If the `feeType` is `FIXED`, then the method returns a fixed fee amount of $2. If the `feeType` is `PERCENTAGE`, then the method returns 50% of the payment amount.

Here is an example of a unit test for the above code using JUnit:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class PaymentFeeCalculatorTest {
    
    @Test
    public void testFixedFee() {
        double paymentAmount = 100.0;
        double expectedFee = 2.0;
        double actualFee = PaymentFeeCalculator.calculateFee(paymentAmount, PaymentFeeCalculator.FeeType.FIXED);
        assertEquals(expectedFee, actualFee, 0.0);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testPercentageFee() {
        double paymentAmount = 100.0;
        double expectedFee = 50.0;
        double actualFee = PaymentFeeCalculator.calculateFee(paymentAmount, PaymentFeeCalculator.FeeType.PERCENTAGE);
        assertEquals(expectedFee, actualFee, 0.0);
    }
    
    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void testInvalidFeeType() {
        double paymentAmount = 100.0;
        PaymentFeeCalculator.calculateFee(paymentAmount, null);
    }
}
```

The `testFixedFee` method tests the case where the fee type is `FIXED` and the payment amount is 100.0. The expected fee is $2.0. 

The `testPercentageFee` method tests the case where the fee type is `PERCENTAGE` and the payment amount is 100.0. The expected fee is 50% of $100.0, which is $50.0.

The `testInvalidFeeType` method tests the case where the fee type is null, which should throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

Refactor the code using replace conditional with polymorphism

## ChatGPT
To refactor the code using "replace conditional with polymorphism," we will first create an abstract class `Fee` with two subclasses `FixedFee` and `PercentageFee`. Each subclass will implement its own `calculateFee` method. 

Here is the updated code:

```java
public abstract class Fee {
    
    public abstract double calculateFee(double paymentAmount);
    
}

public class FixedFee extends Fee {
    
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return 2.0;
    }
    
}

public class PercentageFee extends Fee {
    
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return paymentAmount * 0.5;
    }
    
}

public class PaymentFeeCalculator {

    private Fee fee;

    public PaymentFeeCalculator(Fee fee) {
        this.fee = fee;
    }

    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return fee.calculateFee(paymentAmount);
    }

}
```

In the above code, we have removed the `FeeType` enum and created two classes `FixedFee` and `PercentageFee`, each implementing the `calculateFee` method. We have also created a separate class `PaymentFeeCalculator` that takes an object of the `Fee` class in its constructor.

The `PaymentFeeCalculator` class uses the `calculateFee` method of the `Fee` object to calculate the fee amount. 

Here's an example of how to use the refactored code:

```java
Fee fixedFee = new FixedFee();
PaymentFeeCalculator calculator1 = new PaymentFeeCalculator(fixedFee);
double fee1 = calculator1.calculateFee(100.0);  // returns 2.0

Fee percentageFee = new PercentageFee();
PaymentFeeCalculator calculator2 = new PaymentFeeCalculator(percentageFee);
double fee2 = calculator2.calculateFee(100.0);  // returns 50.0
```

We have created two instances of the `Fee` class (`FixedFee` and `PercentageFee`) and passed them to the constructor of `PaymentFeeCalculator`. We then calculate the fee amount for each instance of `PaymentFeeCalculator`. 

This refactored code is more extensible as it is easy to add new fee types in the future by creating new subclasses of `Fee`. It is also easier to test each fee type in isolation, by creating a separate unit test for each subclass of `Fee`.

Refactor the code using extract delegate for fee calculator resolver

## ChatGPT
To refactor the code using "extract delegate," we will create a new class called `FeeCalculatorResolver` that will delegate the responsibility of resolving the fee calculator instance to a dedicated method. The `PaymentFeeCalculator` class will call this method to obtain the appropriate `Fee` object, which it will then use to calculate the fee amount.

Here is the updated code:

```java
public class Fee {
    
    public interface FeeCalculator {
        double calculateFee(double paymentAmount);
    }
    
    private FeeCalculator calculator;
    
    public Fee(FeeCalculator calculator) {
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }
    
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return calculator.calculateFee(paymentAmount);
    }
    
}

public class FixedFeeCalculator implements Fee.FeeCalculator {

    @Override
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return 2.0;
    }
    
}

public class PercentageFeeCalculator implements Fee.FeeCalculator {

    @Override
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return paymentAmount * 0.5;
    }
    
}

public class FeeCalculatorResolver {
    
    public static Fee.FeeCalculator resolve(String feeType) {
        switch (feeType) {
            case "fixed":
                return new FixedFeeCalculator();
            case "percentage":
                return new PercentageFeeCalculator();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid fee type");
        }
    }
    
}

public class PaymentFeeCalculator {
    
    private Fee fee;

    public PaymentFeeCalculator(String feeType) {
        Fee.FeeCalculator calculator = FeeCalculatorResolver.resolve(feeType);
        Fee fee = new Fee(calculator);
        this.fee = fee;
    }

    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return fee.calculateFee(paymentAmount);
    }
    
}
```

In the above code, we have extracted the `FeeCalculatorResolver` class which contains a static method `resolve` that takes a `feeType` string and returns the appropriate `FeeCalculator` object. The `Fee` class has been modified to use the `FeeCalculator` interface and delegate the calculation of the fee amount to the `FeeCalculator` object.

The `PaymentFeeCalculator` class now takes a `feeType` string in its constructor and resolves the `FeeCalculator` object using the `FeeCalculatorResolver`. It then creates a new `Fee` instance with the resolved `FeeCalculator` and calls its `calculateFee` method to calculate the fee amount.

Here's an example of how to use the `PaymentFeeCalculator` class:

```java
PaymentFeeCalculator calculator1 = new PaymentFeeCalculator("fixed");
double fee1 = calculator1.calculateFee(100.0);  // returns 2.0

PaymentFeeCalculator calculator2 = new PaymentFeeCalculator("percentage");
double fee2 = calculator2.calculateFee(100.0);  // returns 50.0
```

We create two instances of `PaymentFeeCalculator` -- one with the fee type "fixed" and another with the fee type "percentage". The `calculateFee` method uses the delegated `FeeCalculator` object to calculate the fee amount. 

This refactored code separates the responsibility of resolving the `FeeCalculator` from its usage. It also makes it easier to add new fee types in the future by simply adding a new implementation of the `FeeCalculator` interface and updating the `FeeCalculatorResolver` class.

Refactor the code: Extract Class FeeRecord contains payment and fee type

## ChatGPT
To refactor the code using "Extract Class," we will create a new class called `FeeRecord` that will include both the payment amount and fee type. `PaymentFeeCalculator` will take `FeeRecord` as input and return the calculated fee amount.

Here is the updated code:

```java
public class FeeRecord {
    private double paymentAmount;
    private Fee.FeeCalculator calculator;

    public FeeRecord(double paymentAmount, Fee.FeeCalculator calculator) {
        this.paymentAmount = paymentAmount;
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }

    public double getPaymentAmount() {
        return paymentAmount;
    }

    public Fee.FeeCalculator getCalculator() {
        return calculator;
    }
}

public class Fee {
    public interface FeeCalculator {
        double calculateFee(double paymentAmount);
    }

    private FeeCalculator calculator;

    public Fee(FeeCalculator calculator) {
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }

    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return calculator.calculateFee(paymentAmount);
    }
}

public class FixedFeeCalculator implements Fee.FeeCalculator {
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return 2.0;
    }
}

public class PercentageFeeCalculator implements Fee.FeeCalculator {
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return paymentAmount * 0.5;
    }
}

public class FeeCalculatorResolver {
    public static Fee.FeeCalculator resolve(String feeType) {
        switch (feeType) {
            case "fixed":
                return new FixedFeeCalculator();
            case "percentage":
                return new PercentageFeeCalculator();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid fee type");
        }
    }
}

public class PaymentFeeCalculator {
    public double calculateFee(FeeRecord feeRecord) {
        return feeRecord.getCalculator().calculateFee(feeRecord.getPaymentAmount());
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have created a new class called `FeeRecord` which contains `paymentAmount` and `calculator` fields. The `PaymentFeeCalculator` now takes `FeeRecord` as input and returns the calculated fee amount.

The `Fee` class remains the same and implements the `FeeCalculator` interface. The `FixedFeeCalculator` and `PercentageFeeCalculator` classes have also not changed.

The `FeeCalculatorResolver` class resolves the `FeeCalculator` object based on the fee type as before.

Here is an example of how to use the refactored `PaymentFeeCalculator` class:

```java
FeeRecord feeRecord1 = new FeeRecord(100.0, FeeCalculatorResolver.resolve("fixed"));
PaymentFeeCalculator calculator1 = new PaymentFeeCalculator();
double fee1 = calculator1.calculateFee(feeRecord1);  // returns 2.0

FeeRecord feeRecord2 = new FeeRecord(100.0, FeeCalculatorResolver.resolve("percentage"));
PaymentFeeCalculator calculator2 = new PaymentFeeCalculator();
double fee2 = calculator2.calculateFee(feeRecord2);  // returns 50.0
```

We have created two instances of `FeeRecord` -- one with the fee type "fixed" and another with the fee type "percentage". We then create two instances of the `PaymentFeeCalculator` class and pass `FeeRecord` object to the `calculateFee` method.

This refactored code separates the payment amount and fee type into their own class, making it easier to maintain and extend the code in the future.

## Developer
Refactor the code: refactor fee calculator resolver from config in database via Repository interface

## ChatGPT
To refactor the code as described, we will replace `FeeCalculatorResolver` with a `FeeCalculatorRepository` interface that will fetch fee calculation rules from a database. We will create a `FeeCalculatorRepositoryImpl` that implements this interface and fetches the fee calculation rules from the database. `PaymentFeeCalculator` will interact with `FeeCalculatorRepository` to resolve the appropriate `FeeCalculator`.

Here is the updated code:

```java
public class FeeRecord {
    private double paymentAmount;
    private Fee.FeeCalculator calculator;

    public FeeRecord(double paymentAmount, Fee.FeeCalculator calculator) {
        this.paymentAmount = paymentAmount;
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }

    public double getPaymentAmount() {
        return paymentAmount;
    }

    public Fee.FeeCalculator getCalculator() {
        return calculator;
    }
}

public class Fee {
    public interface FeeCalculator {
        double calculateFee(double paymentAmount);
    }

    private FeeCalculator calculator;

    public Fee(FeeCalculator calculator) {
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }

    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return calculator.calculateFee(paymentAmount);
    }
}

public class FixedFeeCalculator implements Fee.FeeCalculator {
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return 2.0;
    }
}

public class PercentageFeeCalculator implements Fee.FeeCalculator {
    @Override
    public double calculateFee(double paymentAmount) {
        return paymentAmount * 0.5;
    }
}

public interface FeeCalculatorRepository {
    Fee.FeeCalculator findByFeeType(String feeType);
}

public class FeeCalculatorRepositoryImpl implements FeeCalculatorRepository {
    @Override
    public Fee.FeeCalculator findByFeeType(String feeType) {
        // logic to fetch fee calculator from database based on fee type
        switch (feeType) {
            case "fixed":
                return new FixedFeeCalculator();
            case "percentage":
                return new PercentageFeeCalculator();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid fee type");
        }
    }
}

public class PaymentFeeCalculator {
    
    private FeeCalculatorRepository feeCalculatorRepository;

    public PaymentFeeCalculator(FeeCalculatorRepository feeCalculatorRepository) {
        this.feeCalculatorRepository = feeCalculatorRepository;
    }

    public double calculateFee(FeeRecord feeRecord) {
        Fee.FeeCalculator calculator = feeCalculatorRepository.findByFeeType(feeRecord.getCalculator().getClass().getSimpleName().toLowerCase());
        return new Fee(calculator).calculateFee(feeRecord.getPaymentAmount());
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have created a new interface called `FeeCalculatorRepository` with a single method `findByFeeType` that fetches `FeeCalculator` instances from a database based on the fee type.

We have also created a new class called `FeeCalculatorRepositoryImpl` that implements the `FeeCalculatorRepository` interface and fetches fee calculation rules from the database based on the fee type.

In the `PaymentFeeCalculator` class, we have removed the previous `FeeCalculatorResolver` class, and now interact with `FeeCalculatorRepository` to fetch the appropriate `FeeCalculator`. 

Here's an example of how to use the updated `PaymentFeeCalculator` class:

```java
FeeCalculatorRepository feeCalculatorRepository = new FeeCalculatorRepositoryImpl();
PaymentFeeCalculator paymentFeeCalculator = new PaymentFeeCalculator(feeCalculatorRepository);

FeeRecord feeRecord1 = new FeeRecord(100.0, new FixedFeeCalculator());
double fee1 = paymentFeeCalculator.calculateFee(feeRecord1);  // returns 2.0

FeeRecord feeRecord2 = new FeeRecord(100.0, new PercentageFeeCalculator());
double fee2 = paymentFeeCalculator.calculateFee(feeRecord2);  // returns 50.0
```

We have created an instance of `FeeCalculatorRepositoryImpl` and passed it to the constructor of `PaymentFeeCalculator`. We then create two instances of `FeeRecord` and pass them to the `calculateFee` method.

This refactored code allows us to fetch the fee calculation rules from a database, making it easier to change rules without modifying the code.
