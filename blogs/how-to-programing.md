# How to programing?

The second post is about how we designing a software by wiring reusable - replaceable components with optimizing usages (maximum extensions & minimum base elements). For maximum extensions & minimum base elements, we use component templates that create custom components before wire or another word is “split creating from using”- creational design patterns. We use Polymorphism to maximum extensions, but besides interface signature parameters, each implementations can requires different additional runtime parameters. We use share data container pattern or context pattern to solve that. Finally, wire components we use Dependency Injection pattern.
