I want to create a language learning app. I want to split it to multiple microservices as much as possible. First, help me to list all microservices. Then design specs of the core microservices in detail using openapi yaml format

List of Microservices:

1. User Management
2. Authentication & Authorization
3. Content Management
4. Course Management
5. Profile Management
6. Recommendation Engine
7. Vocabulary Builder
8. Translation & Pronunciation
9. Quiz & Game
10. Progress Tracking & Reporting

Core Microservices:

1. User Management:

This microservice will store all the user data such as name, email, password, etc. It will also handle user registration, login, and profile updates. In addition, this microservice will integrate with other microservices such as Authentication & Authorization, Content Management, and Course Management.

Specification:

```
openapi: "3.0.0"

info:
  title: User Management API
  description: This API manages user information
  version: "1.0.0"

components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - email
        - password
      properties:
        id:

```


2. Authentication & Authorization:

This microservice will handle user authentication and authorization. It will generate JWT tokens upon successful authentication, which will be used by other microservices to verify the identity of the user. It will also check the user's roles and permissions to ensure that the user has the necessary access to the requested functionality.


Specification:

```
