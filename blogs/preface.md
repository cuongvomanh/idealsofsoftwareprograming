This page is created for analyzing terms, patterns, architectures in software. Analyzing the implementations of those and any best practices implementations of best senior developers that you have seen but not understand the idea behind them clearly. There are a lot of terms, patterns, architectures in software. Study, understand and remember all those terms, patterns, architectures are hard because of huge things to learn. Some are not explained naturally, clearly and some are not actually explained why we have those. And then we just use them without actually understanding them. There are always some more important than the others, some are derived from the others. So when we understand small group of terms, patterns, architectures, we can easily get most of the others. We are going to give you some examples below. You can post your question about terms, patterns, architectures, best practices implementations that you are not understand clearly. Otherwise, you can ask questions about the ideal of the frameworks you are using. Then we would give you the explanation later.
