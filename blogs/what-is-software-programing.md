The first post is about the core software principles and architectures that can help to understand and explain the most of the others. You can explain principles of designing a class, designing a method, SOLID principle and the Clean architecture... So what is different between designing a house, a car engine and designing a software, core components of your software, extensions of your software, libraries, frameworks, and designing classes, methods? Should we use that approach to design software? If we do, we should redefine some software terms. What is designing a software. Designing a software is wiring reusable - replaceable components with optimizing usages (maximum extensions & minimum base elements). Maximum extensions & minimum base elements or the principle that you are more familiar is Loose couple & High Coherent. In OOP languages are served “Loose couple” by providing Polymorphism. That means you can say that Polymorphism is most important term in OOP languages. And for wiring reusable - replaceable components we use well-know patterns like Dependency Injection.
